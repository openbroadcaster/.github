#  OpenBroadcaster Multimedia Framework

OpenBroadcaster focuses on reliability, accessibility and scalability over a having a bloated range of half baked/buggy features.  It has an organic AJAX interface built with Gstreamer, HTML5 and Javascript to deliver a web application in support of broadcast radio and TV automation, media asset management and dynamic community programming.  One [OBServer](https://github.com/openbroadcaster/observer) may manage one or more [OBPlayer](https://github.com/openbroadcaster/obplayer) in a synchronized network configuration or have the server and playout on one device or VM.   There is a robust Plugin Module Architecture with many modules extending the core server application.  The server has a [Documented API](https://docs.openbroadcaster.com/) to enable sharing digital media assets and metadata with revocable secure keys.
